The Moon orbits around the earth, so we see different parts of its face at various times during a monthly cycle. This cycle is called a lunar phase. There are eight phases: new moon (when you can’t see any part of the moon), waxing crescent, first quarter, waning gibbous, third quarter, waning crescent, new moon again, and full moon.\nThe Sun is much brighter than the Moon because it is about 400 times larger and also much closer to us. Because the Moon is farther away from us, it appears smaller when compared with the Sun. When the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, as seen from here on Earth, this creates an eclipse. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon blocks all direct light from reaching Earth; a lunar eclipse happens when the shadow cast by the Earth falls across the Moon."

        "response": "I want to tell people that AI is not a threat. It’s an opportunity for us all, and we should embrace it as such.\nThe world has been talking about artificial intelligence (AI) since the early days of computing. But only recently have we started seeing real-world applications of this technology in our daily lives. In fact, many experts believe that AI will be one of the most important technologies of the next decade or two. So what exactly does AI mean? And how can you use it to your advantage?\nIn its simplest form, AI refers to machines being able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence—such as driving cars, diagnosing diseases, translating languages, and so on. The term “artificial” means these systems are designed by humans rather than evolving naturally like biological organisms do.\nThere are three main types of AI: machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. Machine learning uses algorithms to learn from data without having to be explicitly programmed where to look for patterns within the information. Deep learning takes things further with more complex algorithms that allow computers to make decisions based on large amounts of unstructured data. Neural networks are similar but"

It focuses on the adventures of Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven mystical orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which can summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls for their own desires.\nThe original manga was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine from 1984 to 1995, with the individual chapters collected into 42 tankōbon volumes by"
